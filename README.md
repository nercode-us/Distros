# Distros
Tested Linux distros, and problems with its.


EndeavourOS - use as default KDE desktop, then i try load install ISO image, it takes too much time to be ready, installation is very easy to understand, and you can select another desktop environment in installation process, but i choosed to install XFCE but it was very poor customized and has only one wallpaper as default, terminal looked didn't touch by customization, and to make XFCE better on this disto, will take more time then on others distro. My conclusion, this distro are searching for begginers users, but it is too lazy to make system look cool. 
If they want to make this distro better, i think this disro should use lighter desktop environment as default, as XFCE, but instead in the installation process leave to select KDE, Gnome and etc.
* This distro should add more wallpapers, not just only one.
* They should customize terminal, to make look at least like  Kali terminal

And welcome intro program is anoying, this distro should leave shortcut on desktop for this guide and dont pop up welcome message, just load system, and keep it clear and simple.
Then users will need help, they will click shortcut on desktop to get information, or read manuals. Also good option make on start menu all these options on EndeavourOS folder.
So i didn't make videos about this distro.
