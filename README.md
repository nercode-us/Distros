# Distros
Tested Linux distros, and problems with its.


EndeavourOS - use as default KDE desktop, then i try to load this install ISO image, it takes too much time to be ready, installation is very easy to understand, and you can select another desktop environment in the installation process, i choosed to install XFCE, but it was very poorly customized and has only one wallpaper as default, terminal looked didn't touch by customization, and to make XFCE better on this distro, will take more time than on other distros. My conclusion is that this distro is searching for beginner users, but it is too lazy to make the system look cool. If they want to make this distro better, I think this distro should use a lighter desktop environment as the default, as XFCE, but instead, in the installation process, leave to select KDE, Gnome, etc.
* They should customize terminal, to make look at least like  Kali terminal
* Welcome intro program is anoying, this distro should leave shortcut on penel menu for this guide and dont pop up welcome message, just load system, and keep it clear and simple.
* Welcome program is in "System" and in the "Favorites" folders of the start menu, but this program and other special programs made for this distro should be in EndeavourOS folder.

Then users will need help, they will click shortcuts in start menu to get information, or read manuals.
And this default one wallpaper just talks too much, this distro isn't ready be like rocket, so should use cosmic wallpapers instead.
So i didn't make videos about this distro.
